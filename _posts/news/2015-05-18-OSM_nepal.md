quote: Since the devastating earthquake in Nepal, there have been responses from all
  over the world from relief agencies, governments, non-profits, and ordinary citizens.
  One interesting effort has been from the crowdsourced mapping community, especially
  on OpenStreetMap.org, a free and open web map of the world that anyone can edit.
