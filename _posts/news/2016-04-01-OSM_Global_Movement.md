quote: 'Since its inception in 2004, the growth and maturation of OpenStreetMap is
  evidenced through numerous metrics: in its data collection methodology, its editorial
  support infrastructure, its policies and standards, and, of course, in the quality
  and quantity of its data collection itself.'
