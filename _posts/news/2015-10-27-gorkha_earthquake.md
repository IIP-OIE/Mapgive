quote: With this foresight, in 2012 the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
  Recovery (GFDRR) and the World Bank undertook a small but ultimately critical technical
  assistance activity, mapping the Kathmandu Valley to document the locations of health
  and education facilities. Learning from past devastations, the GFDRR and Bank team
  understood that maps showing basic foundation data and other place-based information
  are critical in disaster preparedness, recovery, and reconstruction activities.
