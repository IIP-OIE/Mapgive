This is the 2nd year that Mapathons and Mapathon related activities were hosted at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) Annual Meeting. Attendees joined a community of online mappers and contributed to five different OpenStreetMap (OSM) projects supporting humanitarian and development efforts. Using satellite imagery and freely available OpenStreetMap editing platforms, participants traced, edited, and labeled key infrastructure (buildings, roads, etc.). This year's event consisted of 7 paper sessions, 2 panel sessions, 2 poster sessions, 2 OSM activities, 6 lightning talks, and 2 Mapathons.
