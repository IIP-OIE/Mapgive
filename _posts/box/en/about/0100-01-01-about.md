[MapGive](http://mapgive.state.gov/) is a Department of State public diplomacy program designed to engage volunteers to map in OpenStreetMap, for humanitarian and development missions. This guide, MapGive in a Box, contains the collective wisdom of the MapGive team, and partners who have organized MapGive events and projects. The goal is to provide clear guidelines for engagement and project design with the MapGive program, for someone with no background in mapping. 

Particularly, this guide is for staff at Post looking to implement MapGive projects, and their bureau colleagues advising on innovative diplomatic engagements. The [Process]({{site.baseurl}}/box/en/process/) section details all concepts, considerations and logistics. <!-- Leadership will be well served by the [Executive Summary]({{site.baseurl}}/en/intro/exec-summary/), to understand the strategic value and resource requirements of MapGive. --> The guide, especially the [Case Studies]({{site.baseurl}}/box/en/cases/), can also facilitate supportive connections for MapGive projects between Posts.

Colleagues at other agencies, in other governments, and other organizations also have similar needs to succinctly explain how to organize projects with OpenStreetMap; the guide may be directly useful, and is open for reuse and adapation. All of the content is [available openly]({{site.baseurl}}/box/en/contribute/), and utilizes existing resources and links as much as possible.

The MapGive team is [ready to help]({{site.baseurl}}/en/resources/contact/), and MapGive in a Box will help you prepare to work with the team. How much good can we do together?
