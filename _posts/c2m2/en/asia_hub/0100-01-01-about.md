The Asia Hub guides two city projects; the South Asia project located in Dhaka, Bangladesh and the Central Asia project in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  In Dhaka, the city project studies the migration of economically vulnerable populations to coastal regions.  In Ulaanbaatar, the project will work in ger communities – informal settlements – to assess access to critical health services.  The Asia Hub is creating data and analysis methodologies for use throughout the region.
