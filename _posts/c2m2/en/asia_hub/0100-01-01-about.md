The Asia Hub guides two projects in South Asia and city project in Central Asia.  The South Asia projects are located in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Kathmandu, Nepal.  The Central Asia project is in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  In Dhaka, the city project will study the migration of economically vulnerable populations to coastal regions.  Focusing on livelihoods, the Kathmandu project will examine the impact of COVID-19 on tourism, a critical economic activity of Nepal.  In Ulaanbaatar, the project will work in ger communities – informal settlements – to assess access to critical health services.
