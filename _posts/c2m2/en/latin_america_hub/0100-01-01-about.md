<p>
Latin America has experienced critical economic challenges due to the pandemic.  The Latin America Hub focuses on the spatial analysis and visualization of the emergent properties of poverty in the form of migration and the collapse of the tourism industry in different cities.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, projects will be undertaken in Quito, Ecuador; Santiago, Chile; and Lima, Peru to track migration and mobility of vulnerable populations and their access to services and resources.  A comparative study will be undertaken to examine the collapse of the tourism industry in Santa Cruz, Galapagos, Ecuador; Cuzco, Peru; and Ouro Preto, Brazil.  The hub will incorporate the results of these studies as they create models and other decision making tools for use by stakeholders in the region to mitigate COVID second order impacts.
