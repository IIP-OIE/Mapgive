    Specifically, projects will be undertaken in Quito, Ecuador; Santiago, Chile; and Lima, Peru to track migration and mobility of vulnerable populations and their access to services and resources.  A comparative study will be undertaken to examine the collapse of the tourism industry in Santa Cruz, Galapagos, Ecuador; Cuzco, Peru; and Ouro Preto, Brazil.  The hub will incorporate the results of these studies as they create models and other decision making tools for use by stakeholders in the region to mitigate COVID second order impacts.
