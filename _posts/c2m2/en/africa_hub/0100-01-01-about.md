The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/07/08/learning-from-the-best-evaluating-africas-covid-19-responses/">COVID-19 impact on African countries</a> has followed a gradual trend as opposed to the rapid surges occurring elsewhere. Given this context, Africa is an important region to examine and understand how countries have prepared themselves to manage the second order impacts of the pandemic. 
</p>
<p>
The Africa Hub focuses on three cities across the continent: 1) Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo; 2) Nairobi, Kenya; and 3) Pemba, Mozambique.  These projects address second order impacts related to access to social services, such as education, water, and health. Additionally, the Africa Hub will promote technical exchanges with partners in Abidjan, Ivory Coast; Accra, Ghana, and Conakry, Guinea to share lessons learned and best practices..
