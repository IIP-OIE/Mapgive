Almost two decades ago the water kept on rising along the Piura river, due to weeks of relentless rain. Eventually the river overflooded and water swept onto the riverside homes, including the University of Piura. Many people became displaced, and many had to be rescued. Dozens of bridges were destroyed. Lakes sprang up in the desert. In other places the water simply pooled. Malaria thrived due to the increase of mosquitos. 
<p>
With the memory of the hardship and destruction produced by the 1997–98 El Niño in northern Peru, the city of Piura has been determined to better prepare for the current El Niño weather pattern. Last year, the <a href='https://twitter.com/reosouthamerica' target='_blank'>South American REO office</a> visited Piura and shared the MapGive and Secondary Cities initiatives with them. After this visit, the city of Piura was eager to participate in a MapGive Workshop.
<p>
The Piura MapGive Workshop took place 10-12 February and introduced field data collection techniques in OpenStreetMap (OSM), using <a href='http://openmapkit.org/' target='_blank'>OpenMapKit</a> and <a href='http://fieldpapers.org/' target='_blank'>FieldPapers</a>; editing in OpenStreetMap; and use of OpenStreetMap data in GIS. The workshop introduced a suite of skills and tools designed to empower participants with the capability to map Piura comprehensively. The open map data created can be used for various types of analysis and visualization.
<p> 
Building a better basemap helps communities develop an assessment of risk due to flooding and other climate related hazards. When current population estimates are not available, the number of buildings can be used to estimate the population at risk. A more complete road network can improve evacuation planning. 
<p>
For the workshop, the MapGive team partnered with the South American REO office and the University, also the <a href='https://www.mapbox.com/blog/tags/ayacucho/' target='_blank'>MapBox Ayacucho office</a> provided two instructors. We had over 50 participants including from INDECI, the agency in Peru that is in charge of disaster preparedness and response. The workshop got off to a great start with community engagement exercises and a Mapathon. This was followed by remarks from several prominent speakers including the Governor of Piura and the University Rector.
<p>
The workshop participants braved the heat the following two days doing some mapping in the field, including taking some great ground photos with Mapillary and using OpenMapKit on their smartphones. This was coupled with additional classroom instructions covering how to import data into OpenStreetMap and how to make web maps.
<p>
MapGive is looking forward to helping grow and linking up communities around open mapping in Peru such as in Cusco, Lima, and Piura. This includes making connections with existing OpenStreetMap communities within the country and throughout South America.
